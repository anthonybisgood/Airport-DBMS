Questions/ Concerns
1.) Are passengers allowed more than 1 benefit?
2.) How are we storing dates in Flight
3.) Field names should not have spaces, so just remove spaces from ERD when naming fields

For query 2, does the list of passengers mean passenger ID or first/last name
QUERY 2:
select PassengerID, NumBags
from PassengerTrip join Flight on (flightID)
where extract(DAY from Flight.BoardingTime) = %d and 
extract(MONTH from Flight.BoardingTime) = 3
